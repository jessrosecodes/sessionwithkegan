forgetting password fuck ups
started a linux ON THE SAME MACHINE where linux was already installed from a LIVE CD (<--wtf)
then we MOUNTED the hard drive of the installed linux 
then we "chrooted" into the installed hard drive as root
using ls /home we figure out my username (spacecat) 
then we used the "passwd" command to COMMAND IT TO OBEY ME (passwd spacecat aka reset spacecat's password)

 fuck roomates
